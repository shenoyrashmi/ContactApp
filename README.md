The Contact Manager App is a simple yet efficient Android application that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contact information. 
It is built using Kotlin, follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, utilizes Jetpack Compose for the modern UI layer, and Room Database for local data persistence.
